4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   go test -race ./...
   ```

5. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: description of what you added"
   git commit -m "Fix: description of what you fixed"
   git commit -m "Update: description of what you changed"

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csnp/qramm-cryptoscan.git
cd qramm-cryptoscan
go build -o cryptoscan ./cmd/cryptoscan
```

### Running Tests

## Adding New Patterns

To add new cryptographic detection patterns:

1. Edit `pkg/patterns/matcher.go`
2. Add a new `Pattern` struct with:
   - Unique ID (e.g., "RSA-001")
   - Descriptive name
   - Category
   - Compiled regex
   - Severity level
   - Quantum risk classification
   - Description and remediation guidance

3. Add tests in `pkg/patterns/matcher_test.go`

Example:
```go
{
    ID:          "NEW-001",
    Name:        "New Pattern Name",
    Category:    "Category Name",
    Regex:       regexp.MustCompile(`your-regex-here`),
    Severity:    types.SeverityHigh,
    Quantum:     types.QuantumVulnerable,
    Algorithm:   "AlgorithmName",
    Description: "What this pattern detects",
    Remediation: "How to fix it",
}
```

## Style Guidelines

- Follow standard Go conventions
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for exported functions
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

## Testing Guidelines

- Write table-driven tests where appropriate
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just percentage

## Questions?

- Open an issue for questions
- Join discussions in existing issues
- Reach out via [CSNP](https://csnp.org)
